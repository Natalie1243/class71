      <p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

      <p class="text-muted text-left">It's a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Must haired tour guide so it will be batter to under stand all the things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago</p>

      <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

      <p>I love the movie Matilda because the movie was about a girl name Matilda who has powers and she is smart as well she did very well at the end and also I like her teacher miss Honey it was just a great movie watch the movie it is good and also I think that Ms Trunchbull ran away and has never been seen ever again and also I saw Ms Honey's students got surprised when Ms Honey said "I am not 7 years old aunt Trunchbull" and I think Matilda is strong and smart. Matilda did the best pranks on her family and Ms Trunchbull and it made me laugh and they were just the funniest pranks i ever seen. and also the part where she dance was my favorite scene because the music was just a great song i love Matilda's dance moves in that scene. I actually saw the movie Matilda at school just 2 years ago and I love the movie well first I read the book and then I watch the trailer and then i watch the movie Matilda and I love it allot. and great acting by Mara Wilson. and I love the movie so much so watch it it is 10/10 good and the movie Matilda was a funny and great movie. and Matilda is related to Harry Potter imagined if Harry Potter was in Matilda that would be funny. not only I love the movie Matilda but I had love Mara Wilson ever since. Ms Jennifer Honey and Matilda are best friends the movie is a great movie to watch and also her parents and brother are rude including ms trunchbull but she defeat them and I one question WHERE IS MATILDA 2? I just wanna know where the next Matilda will come out and also great acting by Mara Wilson, Danny Devito, Pam Ferris, Embeth Davidtz, and Rhea Perlman this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.</p>

      <p>An emotional cathartic tribute that provides not only a much-needed release to help us deal with loss but an intelligent political thriller.

        The performances are extremely personal and moving all around, but Angela Bassett delivers a powerhouse performance. 
        The film is emotionally heavy but knows when to lighten the mood. The humour works. Michaela Coel and Winston duke are underused but hysterical. Danai Gurira also steps up her comedic chops.
        Having a proper antagonist you can side with is always an element of the best Marvel films or any film for that matter, and they go back with that ingredient to enhance the emotional impact. Tenoch Huerta does a fantastic job getting our buy-in. 
        
        From a technical aspect, the sound design, and the visual FX are spectacular. The FX has improved by leaps and bounds over the previous film. 
        Both Oscar winners for the previous film, the score by Ludwig Göransson, and Ruth Carter's costume design, went above their previous work in the franchise and found new ways to incorporate some new elements and not just rely on what they created before.
        
        The one minor gripe I have is the introduction of a character who is clearly there because they are getting their own show. At least they are worked in with some purpose as part of the story and the actress Dominique Thorne is pretty good.
        
        It's nice to go back to MCU film that feels very personal and easy to engage in. It is like going back to see old friends.
        Plus the one mid-scene credit actually means something and is not a cryptic throwaway or silly gag as in recent features.</p>
